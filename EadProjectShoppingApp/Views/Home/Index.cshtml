                    A tiny cell phone device has moved past being a mere communication tool. An advanced form of cell phone – smartphone – is the most handy device as of today. Not only does it consist of the main basic phone functions, it also incorporates any gadgets one can possibly imagine: camera, video camera, GPS, internet server, games. With such a useful all-in-one device, one would almost never have to worry about forgetting something important.

                    Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and physical appearance of keyboards. Slates and booklets do not have a physical keyboard, and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on a touchscreen-enabled display. Hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s all have physical keyboards (although these are usually concealable or detachable), yet they typically also make use of virtual keyboards. Some 2-in-1s have processors and operating systems like a full laptop, whilst having the flexibility of being used as a tablet. Most tablets can use separate keyboards connected using Bluetooth.
